==*7.2.	System Requirements*==
==*Android*==

  * Windows XP (32-bit), Vista (32- or 64-bit), or Windows 7 (32- or 64- bit)
  * Mac OS X 10.5.8 or later (x86 only)
  * Linux (tested on Ubuntu Linux, Lucid Lynx)
  * GNU C Library (glibc) 2.7 or later is required.
  * On Ubuntu Linux, version 8.04 or later is required.

==*Eclipse IDE*==

  * Eclipse 3.5 (Galileo) or greater
  * Eclipse JDT plugin (included in most Eclipse IDE packages)
  * Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
  * Eclipse Classic (versions 3.5.1 and higher)
  * Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers
  * JDK 5 or JDK 6 (JRE alone is not sufficient)
  * Android Development Tools plugin (recommended)

==* IPhone : Mac OS X Lion System Requirements*==

  * In order to install application Mac OS X 10.7 will be need:
Intel Core 2 Duo, Core i3, Core i5, Core i7, or Xeon processor 2GB of RAM 
  * Mac OS X 10.6.6 or later with the Mac App Store installed at least 4GB of additional disk space to accommodate the download, but more is obviously recommended

  * To develop for the iPhone you will need an Intel-based Mac running Leopard (OS X 10.5.3 or later). 
  * If you have a solid grounding in Cocoa development (Apple’s Objective-C framework) with the xCode development on the Mac platform, developing iPhone Apps should be a breeze
  * Everything you need to build an iPhone App is contained in the huge      iPhone App SDK. Like everything else on the Mac, installing it as my first Mac App was a bit of a challenge. I had never heard of .dmg files, let alone used one, to download and install Mac apps. With the help of this Images explanation, that challenge was soon overcome.

==*Tablets: Control4 MyHome iPad*==

  * Control4 MyHome app for iPad—iOS 3.2 or 
later and Control4 OS 1.7.4 or later (OS 1.7.4 or 
1.8.2 require a software patch)
Licenses
  * Single device license (C4-MyHome). For one 
(1) supported device only. Supports Control4 
OS 1.7.4 or later.
==*7.3.	Licensing security and Installation.
 * The iOS SDK for developing iPhone, iPad, iPod provides every iOS APl with a high level of security. According to iOS Developer Library, each iOS application will have these security features: 

==*Local Security:*==

  * Local security includes the password protection offered by the Finder, encryption of data provided by FileVault, BSD access permissions, and access permissions added to applications through use of Authorization Services (Apple, 2001).

==*Remote Transport Security:*==

  * Many of the security APIs provided by Mac OS X and iOS are useful in this regard, including the secure networking APIs (Secure Transport, CFNetwork, and URL Loading System), and Certificate, Key, and Trust Services (Apple, 2001).

==*Certificate, Key, and Trust Services:*==

In iOS, additional functions are provided to:

  * Use a private key to generate a digital signature for a block of data.
  * Use a public key to verify a signature.
  * Use a public key to encrypt a block of data.
  * Use a private key to decrypt a block of data (Apple, 2001).
